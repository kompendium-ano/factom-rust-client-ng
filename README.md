The Library developed by [Kompendium, LLC](https://kompendium.co) in partnership with [Kelecorix, Inc](https://kelecorix.com) and [Sergey Bushnyak](https://sigrlami.eu) for the good of the Factom community. While we see the usage of the libraries over the months, the Factom community decided not to support this work in the form of a grant either upfront or as backpay on multiple occasions ([1](https://factomize.com/forums/threads/kompendium-12-back-pay-two-factom-community-sdks-client-libraries-php-ruby.4802/), [2](https://factomize.com/forums/threads/kompendium-12-back-pay-ruby-haskell-client-libraries-for-the-factom-blockchain.2740/), [3](https://factomize.com/forums/threads/back-pay-development-of-4-json-rpc-client-libraries-to-the-factom-community.2513/))
